Reproduction of snapshot recovery bug.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Build project using sbt


2) Launch bug.persistencebug.Main
3) Launch bug.persistencebug.simulator.SimulatorMain

This will cause a tree to be created in the Core actor system, and a snapshot of each actor will be generated under
target/snapshots.

4) Stop both mains and restart just the bug.persistencebug.Main

This will recover the Core actor system from the snapshots but the tree will not be correctly reproduced. The root
node of the tree will have the wrong Snapshot offered (and this will be seen from the log output).

---

A workaround to the problem is to change the code on line 68 of SearchTreeNode.scala to reverse the order of 'name' and
'nodeName' so that the persistenceId runs from node to root, rather than root to node.
